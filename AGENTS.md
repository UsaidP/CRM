# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Agent memory (agentmemory)

You have persistent long-term memory via the agentmemory MCP server. Tools: `memory_recall`, `memory_smart_search`, `memory_save`, `memory_sessions`.

- At the START of a task, call `memory_recall` (or `memory_smart_search`) with the task context to load relevant past decisions, fixes, and preferences before asking the user to repeat anything.
- When you learn something durable (a decision, a fix, a gotcha, a user preference, a project convention), call `memory_save` to persist it.
- Prefer recalling over re-deriving, and save concise reusable facts rather than transcripts.
